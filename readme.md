Zope Extension
==============

Adds extra functionality to Visual Studio Code when developing Zope applications.

### Tasks

 - update the tree view with config options (probably just show a button to start using extension in this directory - remember this in VSC general user data?)
 - recognise python files (without extension) and set file type automatically for those documents
 - recognise sql files (if possible - might need to register these in a cache of choices?)
 - import the dtml language description (will need to be set for files with no extension)
 - test registration of directory when using workspaces
 - add command to determine where file is in hierachy when using references that look them up
